## About the Eval0 project. This is the Typescript SDK for Eval0.

Eval0 - One line AI for your Applications
eval0.dev

**Eval0** is a lightweight SaaS API that tackles quick, everyday computing and AI-driven tasks—by simply calling a single function, `eval0(query)`. Whether you need to validate user input, classify content, perform short calculations, or generate micro-summaries, Eval0 offers straightforward, **1–5 word responses** that developers can seamlessly integrate into any project.

Modern applications demand **quick, on-the-fly answers** to common questions. Rather than spinning up large, complex AI models or juggling multiple libraries, Eval0’s minimalistic approach ensures:

1. **Simplicity** – A single function call for all tasks.
2. **Speed** – Low-latency API responses optimized for real-time applications.
3. **Versatility** – Handles numerous everyday checks, short classifications, micro-summaries, and more.

### **Example Use Cases**

1. **Validation**
    
    ```python
    result = eval0("Is this a valid URL?", "http://example.com")
    # Returns: "Yes"
    ```
    
    - Quickly check URL, email, or phone number validity in sign-up forms.
2. **Short Classification**
    
    ```python
    result = eval0("Is this sentence positive or negative?", "I absolutely love this movie!")
    # Returns: "Positive"
    ```
    
    - Gauge sentiment or tone with minimal overhead.
3. **Micro-Summarization**
    
    ```python
    result = eval0("Summarize in 5 words:", "Blockchain technology will revolutionize finance globally.")
    # Returns: "Blockchain revolutionizes global finance."
    ```
    
    - Provide condensed ideas for content previews or headlines.
4. **Mini Fact Check**
    
    ```python
    result = eval0("Is this fact true or false?", "The Earth is flat.")
    # Returns: "False"
    ```
    
    - Offer quick factual checks in a knowledge base or FAQ section.
5. **Topic Tagging**
    
    ```python
    result = eval0("Tag this product:", "Apple Macbook Pro 16inch")
    # Returns: "Laptop"
    ```
    
    - Effortlessly categorize products, blog posts, or messages.

### **Who Benefits?**

- **Startups and Small Teams**  
    Save time and resources by offloading tasks you’d otherwise manually code or train a model for.
- **Mid-Sized Enterprises**  
    Standardize input validations and micro-AI tasks across teams without building from scratch.
- **Large Organizations**  
    Offload simpler tasks to keep your internal AI resources free for complex projects.

---

### **How Does It Work?**

1. **Sign Up** for an Eval0 account and receive your API key.
2. **Install** the appropriate **SDK** or make direct REST calls if you prefer.
3. **Call** `eval0(query, data...)` with the question or instruction, plus any input strings or numbers.
4. Receive a **1–5 word** answer—fast, clean, and ready to use.

---

### **Potential and Roadmap**

- **Scalable Infrastructure**: With rising API calls, Eval0’s backend can handle millions of requests without downtime.
- **Advanced Models**: Future plans include domain-specific expansions (legal checks, medical disclaimers, financial fact-checking) for specialized needs.
- **Customizable Output**: Paid tiers could allow advanced parameters like output confidence scores or multilingual responses.

### **Conclusion**

Eval0 is **the “just works” approach** to quick AI-driven evaluations, calculations, and validations. By stripping away complexities and funneling it all into one reliable, **easy-to-integrate function**, Eval0 aims to **maximize developer productivity** and **minimize overhead**.

**Try Eval0** and start evaluating anything with **one line of code**—it’s that simple!

## How I like the Eval0 npm package to be structured

```
import { eval0 } from "eval0";
import { eval0 } from "eval0/stream";
```

this is how I like the Eval0 npm package to be called in my projects. Internally to start we will use Vercel AI SDK to run the eval0 function. We will use OPENAI_API_KEY to call the OPENAI API.
